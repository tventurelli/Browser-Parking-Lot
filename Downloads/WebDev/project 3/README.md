# Browser Parking Lot

The objective of this project is to store useful links with a todo item that can be prioritized using the labels HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.

An item contains:

- a link

- a short text description

- date of creation

- priority label (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `)

The Browser Parking Lot enables you to eliminate tabs in your browser. Therefore, we reduce memory consumption of your computer, because using the browser as a todo list is counterproductive.
